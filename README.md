# Student-Mental-Health-Analysis
College Project under the "Probability and Statistics" Course


Mental health refers to a state of emotional, cognitive and behavioural well being. Unfortunately, it doesnâ€™t get the attention that it requires. This negligence has a significant impact on health, social, economic factors and human rights.
Surveys by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) revealed that 12-13 per cent of students in India suffer from psychological, emotional and behavioural conditions.

Through this analysis, we aim to understand the relation between depression among college students and their CGPA, Age, Gender and some other factors.
